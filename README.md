### Abstract 

This paper mainly talks about cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in hepatocyte [1]. Cholesterol is a sterol, biosynthesized by all animal cells. It is a significant structural component of all animal cell membranes and is essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Because not only high level of cholesterol in blood is the major risk of cardiovascular disease, but also insufficient cholesterol causes cytotoxicity through compromised membrane structure. The intracellular cholesterol levels are strictly regulated, which make it vital to understand the mechanism of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
