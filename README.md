## Model_Implementation

The paper is [here](https://github.com/JialinZhang0/Model_Implementation/blob/main/Model_Implementation_of_Cholesterol_Biosynthesis.pdf)

### Abstract 

This paper mainly talks about cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in hepatocyte [1]. Cholesterol is a sterol, biosynthesized by all animal cells. It is a significant structural component of all animal cell membranes and is essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Because not only high level of cholesterol in blood is the major risk of cardiovascular disease, but also insufficient cholesterol causes cytotoxicity through compromised membrane structure. The intracellular cholesterol levels are strictly regulated, which make it vital to understand the mechanism of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.


## Peripheral_Nerve_Regeneration

### Abstract

Peripheral nerve plays a vital role in the communication between brain and body. The regeneration of peripheral nerve has been studied for several years. The traditional strategy is called Tensionless end-to-end repair, which can only function when there is very small gap between the injury and when endoneurium is not damaged. A new emerging method is called Tissue Engineered Never Grafts (TENGs), which can be implanted into a nerve and are hypothesized to repair larger gaps after injury. Given that current methods have yet to achieve complete functional recovery and issues have arisen with biocompatibility, TENGs further are developed by loading other growth factors, like Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Recent results have shown that a sustained release of GDNF in vitro led to an improvement of the nerve regeneration of Schwann cells. However, this is only confirmed in vitro and in an animal model. As for the animal model, the previous way is to use rodent animals, like rat, because rat is small animal and its nerve cell grow faster and it is easy to conduct more experiment. But considering the big difference between rats and humans, the sheep are used for study to more closely replicate the complexity and size of a human patient. Sheep models have been shown to be one of the most relevant animal models for studying nerve regeneration. Although scientists established good results in sheep models, sheep are still different from human beings. To address the problems showed in these studies, we can combine GDNFTENGs with Partial Artificial Human-Like Tissue (PAHLT), which not only can improve the speed of peripheral nerve cells (PNCs) growth for the introduction of GDNF to TENGs, but also can increase the biocompatibility for the very similar system as human.


## Project-based Machine Learning Project—Recommendation System

In this project, I build a recommendation system with the given dataset of movie ratings by users. Based on ratings I have, you recommended five movies to each user, and my recommendations were evaluated on the held-out dataset.
